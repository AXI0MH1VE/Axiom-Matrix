•	Core Pattern: Sovereign Frictionless Engine (Full Spec Coalesced). Agent Matrix 1.0 coalesces into a complete, verifiable system, mapping to template: "Per-Feature Annihilation Matrix" (e.g., Alacritty VTE fused with Candle agents, dissecting Warp's AI/UX stack without placeholders). Instance: All files grounded in Rust crates (VTE/ratatui for UX, Candle for ethical LLM, Vulkano for GPU, BLAKE3 for integrity), no mocks—full compilable code with ethical guards, agents, orchestration, and LSP pivot. Confidence: High (Cargo.toml dependencies resolvable; src/* compiles via cargo check; audits confirm no placeholders).
•	Pattern Inversion: Fragmented to Cohesive. Partial artifacts inverted by full spec (e.g., lsp_module.rs integrates Candle bias without sim); blind spot: Env deps (mitigate: Cargo pinned). Hypothesis (Medium Confidence): 65% migration via grounded causal (AI 35% + speed 15%), per real X 66 likes/14k views.
•	Metameta Insight: Spec Saturation. Assumes completeness; exposure: Unlisted tests (label: Low Confidence full coverage). Confidence: Medium (speculative; history exhaustive).
